| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Storage space | The storage space the artifact belongs to. |
| Repository | The repository the artifact belongs to. |
| Artifact path | Where the artifact is located in the repository tree. **Click to open the artifact detail page.** |
| Last used | The last time the artifact was used. Sort by most/least recent. |
| Downloads | How many times the artifact was downloaded. Sort by most/least. |
| Size | File size of the artifact. Sort by largest/smallest. |
| Vulnerabilities | From left to right (red → green): counts of **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low** issues. Sort by total vulnerabilities. |

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Storage space | The storage space the artifact belongs to. |
| Repository | The repository the artifact belongs to. |
| Artifact path | Where the artifact is located in the repository tree. |

| Modified time | When the artifact was last modified. |
| Last used | When the artifact was last used. |
| Scan time | When the artifact was last scanned. |
| Downloads | Download count for the artifact. |
| SHA-1 | Artifact SHA‑1 (identifier; suitable for lower security requirements). |
| SM3 | Artifact SM3 (identifier; common in domestic standards; suitable for higher security). |
| SHA-256 | Artifact SHA‑256 (identifier; suitable for higher security). |
| MD5 | Artifact MD5 (identifier; suitable for lower security requirements). |
| Statistics | From left to right: **Total**, **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low** vulnerabilities. |

You can zoom the component map with the mouse wheel. Hover a component to see **total, critical, high, medium, low** vulnerability counts for that component.

The **Component statistics** panel on the right summarizes the **Component info** on the left: **any component with vulnerabilities** is a **risky component**, components **with zero vulnerabilities** are **healthy**.

The lower‑right **license** panel shows license distribution across all components in the artifact. Hover a bar to see the exact count.
