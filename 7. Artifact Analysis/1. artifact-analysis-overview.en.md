# Artifact Analysis Overview

**Folib** supports scanning and analyzing artifacts across three dimensions: **components**, **vulnerabilities**, and **licenses**.

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| **Components** | Independent functional units within an artifact (name, version, group, etc.) used to build and run a system. In **Artifact Scanning**, components include *all* types (both open‑source and in‑house). In **Open‑Source Components**, the term refers **only** to open‑source components. |
| **Vulnerabilities** | Security defects or weaknesses that may lead to attacks or data leakage. Severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low. |
| **Licenses** | Legal terms governing use, distribution, and modification of components/artifacts (e.g., MIT, Apache, commercial licenses). |

## UI Overview

The analysis area includes: **Artifact Scanning**, **Open‑Source Components**, **Vulnerability Library**, and **License Library**. Each subsection is summarized below.

## Artifact Scanning

This module has two screens: a **scanned artifacts list** and an **artifact details** page.  
The **list** shows all artifacts on the platform that were scanned successfully. Click the artifact path to open the **details** page.

## Open‑Source Components

Consists of a **components list** and a **component details** page.  
The **list** displays all open‑source components found on the platform. Click a component name to view its **details**.

## Vulnerability Library

Provides a **vulnerabilities list** and a **vulnerability details** page.  
The **list** shows all vulnerabilities; click a vulnerability ID (e.g., CVE) to open its **details**.
