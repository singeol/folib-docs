## Basic Monitoring

The server hosting the product is monitored in real time. Key charts â€” **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, and **JVM threads** â€” are updated continuously.

|---|---|
| Handle status | Remaining available file descriptors (limit of open files/resources). |
| Storage size | Free disk space on the server. |
| Available memory | Amount of JVM memory currently available. |
| Thread count | Current number of process threads. |
| System load | Current system load indicator. |
| GC time | Time spent per garbage-collection cycle. |
