# User Management

Go to **Settings → User Management**. This module provides core user operations—create, search, update, and delete. With built‑in roles and group edit permissions, it enforces proper access control.

**What you can do:**

1. **User basics**
   - create new user accounts;
   - search and filter users;
   - edit user profile fields;
   - deactivate or delete accounts.
2. **Role management**
   - assign built‑in roles (e.g., admin, global read‑only);
   - change user roles flexibly.
3. **Group permissions**
   - configure which groups may edit a user;
   - control who can view or modify user information.

After basic operations, the page dynamically shows **total users**, **number of admins**, and **number of anonymous users**.

- complete set of basic operations;
- quick assignment of built‑in roles;
- group‑based edit permission control.

## User Search

Three exact (non-fuzzy) search modes are supported:

- **by username** — exact match;
- **by e‑mail** — exact match of address;
- **by role** — exact match of role.

> 💡 *Fuzzy/partial matches are not supported.*

Results include: username, enabled status, e‑mail, roles, and groups. The list updates in real time.

## Create a User

**System Administrators only.** Click **Add User** (top right).

### Profile settings

- **Username** — must be **unique**.
- **Password** — length **12–30**; must include at least **three of**: letters, digits, special characters `~!@#$%^&*()_.`.  
  Example: `example666@abc`.
- **Email** — must be **unique** and follow the standard format (e.g., `username@example.com`).
- **Activate** — when enabled, the account becomes usable across modules. In the user list, the second row “available” indicator reflects activation.

### Role settings

- **ADMIN** — superuser with all privileges.
- **ARTIFACTS_MANAGER** — can upload, delete, move, copy, and **promote** artifacts.
- **GENERAL** — basic permissions: view and download artifacts.
- **OPEN_SOURCE_MANAGE** — open‑source governance: license compliance checks, viewing vulnerability scan results, etc.

### Group settings

All groups are listed with name and description. By default the toggle is **on**—after creation, groups can edit the user (e.g., add the user to the group).
