# Repository Overview

An **artifact repository** is a platform for centrally storing and managing artifacts produced during software development: source code, compiled binaries, dependency libraries, configuration files, documentation, etc. Its main purpose is to provide unified storage and version control so teams can share, retrieve, and manage artifacts easily.

This UI explains the **storage space internal view** for repositories, plus the **Repository Details** and **Repository Statistics** pages.

## Interface Guide

In the **internal view of a storage space**, all repositories under that space are listed on the right. Click a **repository** card to open its **Details** page.

üí° **Explanation of elements in a repository card (inside a space):**  
![Card icons](repository_external_view_icons_description.843395b9.png)

| Element | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Repository usage URL** | The URL clients/tools use to consume the repository. See **Usage Instructions** on the **Repository Details** page for specifics. |
| **Visibility scope** | With the public icon, the repo is **publicly visible**: everyone can see and pull. Without it, the repo is **space‚Äëmember visible**: only members of the space can see and pull. You can change this under **Repository Settings ‚Üí Permissions**. |
| **Repository policy** | **Local** ‚Äî private on‚Äëprem storage; typically for first/second‚Äëparty packages. **Proxy** ‚Äî proxies third‚Äëparty sources (e.g., `aliyun`, `qinghua`) or internal repos across network segments. **Composite (virtual)** ‚Äî aggregates multiple same‚Äëlanguage/related repos, defines order, and exposes a single external endpoint. |
| **Version policy** | **release** ‚Äî only Release versions (production). **snapshot** ‚Äî only Snapshots (development, frequent updates). **mixed** ‚Äî both Release and Snapshot; common for proxy/virtual repos. |

## Repository Details

By default, the **Details** tab is shown.

![Details page](repository_detail_page.11a25d3f.png)

### Browse URL
This is the URL for **browsing the repository directory**. Click the link or paste it into your browser. You can also click the **repository name** (e.g., `generic`) at the top to open the directory.

![Browse URL](address1.48c031c8.png)

The **repository directory** and the **package list** on the Details page show the same folders/files. Click a file to download it.

| Browse view | Package list |

### Usage URL
This is the URL to configure in build tools/clients. Click **Usage Instructions** on the right; the content depends on repo type (e.g., Maven vs. HuggingFace).

### Package List
Shows the folders and files in the repository.

![Package list](package_list.82ea7441.png)

- Clicking the **main area** of a row shows the **basic info and metadata** card on the right.  
- Clicking the **‚Äú>‚Äù** icon at a folder expands its children.

### Basic Information
When entering from the external view, the **basic information** card for the repository is shown by default (right side).

![Basic information](basic_information.fb822312.jpg)

**Common fields (for all three repo types):**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Space** | The storage space the repository belongs to, used to organize and isolate resources. |
| **Repository type** | For example: Maven, Docker, npm, etc. |
| **Policy type** | Local / Proxy / Composite. |
| **Name** | Repository identifier. |
| **Path** | Location in the package list; at root equals the repo name. |
| **Artifact size limit** | Maximum allowed size for a single file. |

**Proxy‚Äëonly fields:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Proxy address** | Upstream endpoint used to forward requests and fetch resources. In internal networks, configure a proxy server to indirectly access the upstream if external access is blocked. |

**Composite‚Äëonly fields:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Composite members** | Child repositories included in the composite (local, proxy, or other composites). |

### Metadata
**Repositories** and **non‚Äëartifact files** (e.g., *.xml*) have **no metadata**.  
**Folders** and **artifact files** (e.g., *.jar*, *.war*) **do** have metadata.  
For details, see *Artifact File Management ‚Äî Overview* (`/help/docs/warefile/warefile-outline.html`).

### Artifact Recycle Bin
Select a file ‚Üí **More** (top‚Äëright) ‚Üí **Delete** ‚Üí confirm. Deleted items go to the **artifact recycle bin**; access it at the bottom of the **package list** to restore items.
