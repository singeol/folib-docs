# Cluster Online Maintenance

## Remove a faulty node online
If one node fails or crashes, remove it from the quorum online first, then perform a repair start.

### Step 1. Remove the faulty node in the UI
Go to **Health Monitoring → Cluster Info** and click **Remove** for the target node.

### Step 2. Run the repair start command
This command repairs the node’s state and restarts it:
```bash
folib repair_start
```

## Multi‑node data repair
The database is distributed: the same data is partially replicated across several nodes. After **repair_start**, also click **Data Repair** in the cluster info page.

> **Note.** Data repair runs in the background and can take some time, but it won’t block usage. Until it finishes, keep using the healthy nodes.
