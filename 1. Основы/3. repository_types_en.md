# Types of Artifact Repositories

## Local Repository
A local repository is the most basic storage type in an artifact repository. It directly stores and manages artifacts/components/packages published by the development team. Typically self‑managed by the team/organization, it holds all related files: source packages, binaries, configuration files, and more. Developers upload their artifacts to the local repository, from which other team members or automated systems download them.

## Proxy Repository
A proxy repository is used to download and cache artifacts from remote sources (e.g., Maven Central, Docker Hub). It acts as an intermediary between local and remote storage: when an artifact is missing locally, the proxy fetches it from the remote repository and caches it for future use.

## Virtual Repository
A virtual (composite) repository aggregates multiple repositories (local, proxy, etc.) and exposes a single entry point to access their artifacts. This lets you access many local and proxy repositories through one “virtual” repository, simplifying access and administration.
